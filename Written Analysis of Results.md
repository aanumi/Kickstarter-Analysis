WRITTEN ANALYSIS OF RESULTS


## Overview of Project
 
This is an analysis of over 4,000 Kickstarter projects to examine trends based on goals, outcomes, and deadlines amongst other categories. Numerous projects have been launched, and only a certain percentage have been relatively successful. In order to meaningfully analyze trends and draw conclusive relationships, we must analyze past projects to discover successful tips to achieving our goals. 

### Purpose
Purpose

To determine how different other campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

Background 
Of the numerous projects launched in the past, we have analyzed projects by country, category, and subcategory at different points in order to view trends, identify relationships. This project presents the results of some of those analysis, such as 'Outcomes Based on Launch Date', and 'Outcomes based on 'Goals'.

## Analysis and Challenges
Analysis
General findings on both (summary findings)


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
General Findings
A good number of projects analyzed based on launch date were successful between April and July. May (111) and June (100) had the highest outcomes of success, so there may be a favorable element in the summer season that's helping the projects succeed. Generally also, very few projects were canceled. The reason behind this might be a good blueprint to study further in order to avoid similar project cancellations for future projects.


Conclusion
Given the dataset analyzed, more kickstarter projects are likely to be successful - because all successful outcomes from January to November were above 50%. The percentage of outcomes that failed (31 - 52) or canceled (<10) were much lower as the trend line to be seen for the 'cancelled' projects fell below 20% in all cases. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
General findings
I find that, for the number of projects, the heavy numbers for both outcomes successful and failed range from <1,000 to 19,999. The percentages also depict a similar picture. Many projects in this category and goal range were not cancelled. This might indicate that the theater category with ranges of <1,000 to >50,000 might be a good dataset to inform decisions and strategy for similar plays and budgets. 

Conclusion
Given the dataset analyzed, about 58.33% of the outcomes based on goals were successful, with the successful outcomes trending downwards for goals in the 45,000 to >50,000 interval class. For the failed outcomes based on goals, the trend starts in the low percentages, but trends upwards, with the highest percentage peaking at 100% for the 45,000 to 49,999 range.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Challenges
Learning to properly use the CountIfs function was slightly challenging, as well as modifying the formula to include the relevant fields of 'goal', 'outcome', and 'plays'.

Overcoming challenge
To overcome this challenge, I used the resources provided in the module, as well as watched other videos on YouTube to help with proper understanding and retention of the concept.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. A big number of successful outcomes happened between April and July, with the highest peaks being May, (111) and June (100). Past July, there was an accelerated decrease of success till December (72 to 37).
2. A very small amount of projects were canceled (<10) in all months, based on the analysis by launch date. This may signify good news for others looking at this research, but a deeper look should be taken to compare that information with relative data, to draw more significant results.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

1. The chart for the percentage of goals successful versus failed trended in perfectly opposite directions. For the successful goals, the highest percent successful was in the high 70%s, with the datapoints trending lower as each goal class increased. Most of the goals form the 45,000 to >50,000 interval class were not successful. For the percentage of goals failed, more of the goals in the high interval classes failed to a higher degree. Lastly, no project in the interval class between <1,000 and >50,000 failed. This might set a good basis for future projects in similar categories, as it is likely that any range outside of the pre-defined range can be canceled.
	

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Summary of dataset limitations
1. The dataset may not be large enough for all subcategories/categories, so the level of significance of the results is questionable. We also need to analyze more/different crowdsourcing companies to draw other/significant insights.
2. The timeline and factors for defining success and failure. We see clear trends from the data analyzed, but does success mean something else when considered in terms of Donations, Goals, Pledges, or even by country? Does success for this goal class range equal success for a tweaked, but different filter factor?


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Recommendation for additional tables or graphs

Other charts that we can create to analyze this data are stacked histograms and bar charts for the 'Outcomes based by Launch Date', and Pie charts for the percentages successful, failed, and canceled in the 'Outcomes Based on Goals' analysis.
